## What is React?

- ‚ÄúA JavaScript library for building user interfaces.‚Äù
- Renders your UI and responds to events.
- Re-renders the whole application on every data change‚Ä¶ very efficiently.

## What problem does React solve?

<BlockQuote>
  <Quote>
    <p>Every framework can be viewed as an attempt to say "the hardest part of writing a webapp is X, so here's some code to make that easier". ‚Ä¶</p>
    <p><strong>Angular</strong> is what you get if you think the biggest problem with writing webapps is that Javascript isn't Java. ‚Ä¶ </p>
    <p><strong>React + Redux</strong> is based on the idea that what's really hard with writing webapps is non-deterministic behaviour and unclear data flow.</p>

## Library !== Framework

These are some features that Angular offers out-of-the-box:

- Routing/Navigation
- Templating engine
- Http client
- Form validation
- Animations
- I18n

## React is all about components
With React you split up your application into reusable components.

Typical components:

- Page header
- Date input control
- Registration form
- Navigation
- Etc.

---

## What is a React component?
A component can receive properties (aka. props) and can have internal state.

Components should only contain display logic.

Writing React components is a bit like writing your own HTML tags:

```html
  <MyComponent myproperty="is awesome"></MyComponent>
```

## Hello World

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>üëãüåç</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App/>, rootElement);
```

## JSX !== HTML

```javascript
function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>üëãüåç</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## JSX is syntactical sugar for

### React.createElement

```javascript
React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World")
```

## Two types of components

<Layout>
<Fill>
<Heading size={4}>Class-based</Heading>
  <Text>Can be stateful</Text>
  <Text>aka. container</Text>
</Fill>
<Fill>
<Heading size={4}>Functional</Heading>
  <Text>Stateless</Text>
  <Text>aka. presentational</Text>
  <Text>Basically only the render method</Text>
  </Fill>
  </Layout>

---

## Class-based component

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: []
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello world</div>
    );
  } 
}
```

---

## Functional component

```javascript
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>Hello World</div>
  );
}
```

## Props

You can think of props as parameters that you can pass to a component.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>üëã{props.name}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App name="Mario"/>, rootElement);
```

## State

```javascript
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      smiles: []
    };
  }
  increase() {
    this.setState({
      smiles: this.state.smiles.concat("üôÇ")
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => this.increase()}>Click me</button>
        <p>{this.state.smiles}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## It‚Äôs all JavaScript

React does not require you to learn a new domain-specific language (e.g. templating) as everything is plain JavaScript.

## List rendering with Angular

#### app.component.ts
```javascript
export class AppComponent {
  list = ["Goodyear", "Dunlop", "Fulda"]
}
```

#### app.component.html
```html
<div>
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let listItem of list">{{listItem}}</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## Why use React?

State of user interfaces is difficult to handle with vanilla JavaScript.

React allows you to focus on your application logic.

De-facto industry standard with a huge ecosystem.

## Brush up your JavaScript fundamentals

Getting into React is the perfect chance to improve your general JavaScript skills.

Here is a good place to start:

## Functional Programming

React & Redux both rely on some Functional Programming paradigms like pure functions, immutability, etc.

Learning those basics will help a lot with understanding React/Redux and also improve your general programming skills.
