## What is React?

- “A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.”
- Renders your UI and responds to events.
- Re-renders the whole application on every data change… very efficiently.

## What problem does React solve?

<BlockQuote>
  <Quote>
    <p>Every framework can be viewed as an attempt to say "the hardest part of writing a webapp is X, so here's some code to make that easier". …</p>
    <p><strong>Angular</strong> is what you get if you think the biggest problem with writing webapps is that Javascript isn't Java. … </p>
    <p><strong>React + Redux</strong> is based on the idea that what's really hard with writing webapps is non-deterministic behaviour and unclear data flow.</p>

## Library !== Framework

These are some features that Angular offers out-of-the-box:

- Routing/Navigation
- Templating engine
- Http client
- Form validation
- Animations
- I18n

# 🤷‍♀️
# React has none of this

# V for ~~Victory~~ View

## React is the V in MVC

# Good or Bad?
<Appear>
  <div>
<Text margin="2rem">
👍 You <S type="bold">can</S> pick exactly the libraries you need
</Text>
</div>
</Appear>
<Appear>
  <div>
<Text>
👎 You <S type="bold">need to</S> pick exactly the libraries you need

## React is all about components
With React you split up your application into reusable components.

Typical components:

- Page header
- Date input control
- Registration form
- Navigation
- Etc.

---

## What is a React component?
A component can receive properties (aka. props) and can have internal state.

Components should only contain display logic.

Writing React components is a bit like writing your own HTML tags:

```html
  <MyComponent myproperty="is awesome"></MyComponent>
```

## Hello World

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>👋🌍</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App/>, rootElement);
```

## JSX !== HTML

```javascript
function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>👋🌍</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## JSX is syntactical sugar for

### React.createElement

```javascript
React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World")
```

## Two types of components

<Layout>
<Fill>
<Heading size={4}>Class-based</Heading>
  <Text>Stateful</Text>
  <Text>aka. container</Text>
</Fill>
<Fill>
<Heading size={4}>Functional</Heading>
  <Text>Stateless</Text>
  <Text>aka. presentational</Text>
  <Text>basically only the render method</Text>
  </Fill>
  </Layout>

---

## Class-based component

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: []
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello world</div>
    );
  } 
}
```

---

## Functional component

```javascript
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>Hello World</div>
  );
}
```

---
export default CodeSlide

## Props

You can think of props as parameters that you can pass to a component.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>👋{props.name}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App name="Mario"/>, rootElement);
```

export default CodeSlide

## State

```javascript
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      smiles: []
    };
  }
  increase() {
    this.setState({
      smiles: this.state.smiles.concat("🙂")
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => this.increase()}>Click me</button>
        <p>{this.state.smiles}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Declarative

## List rendering
Compare with Angular or Vue

## Class-based  VS Functional components

## Separation of concerns?

## Why use React?

State of user interfaces is difficult to handle with vanilla JavaScript.

React allows you to focus on your application logic.

De-facto industry standard with a huge ecosystem.
