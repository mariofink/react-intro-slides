## What problem does React solve?

> Every framework can be viewed as an attempt to say "the hardest part of writing a webapp is {X}, so here's some code to make that easier".
> ‚Ä¶
> Angular is what you get if you think the biggest problem with writing webapps is that Javascript isn't Java.
> ‚Ä¶
> React + Redux is based on the idea that what's really hard with writing webapps is non-deterministic behaviour and unclear data flow.

## React is all about components
With React you split up your application into reusable components.

Typical components:
- Page header
- Date input control
- Registration form
- Navigation
- Etc.

## What is a React component?
A component can receive properties (aka. props) and can have internal state.
Components should only contain display logic.

Writing React components is a bit like writing your own HTML tags:

```html
  <my-component myproperty="is awesome"></my-component>
```

## Props

You can think of props as parameters that you can pass to a component.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

//import "./styles.css";

function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>üëã{props.name}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App name="Mario"/>, rootElement);
```
